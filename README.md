# DNS_Logger
This is a simple yet effective project built using the ESP8266 microcontroller. It creates a Wi-Fi Access Point and captures HTTP traffic and real-time DNS logs from connected client devices. All intercepted logs are displayed on a live web dashboard hosted directly on the ESP8266's built-in web server.
