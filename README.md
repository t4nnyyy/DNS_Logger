ESP8266 Wi-Fi Access Point with Real-Time HTTP & DNS Traffic Logger
This is a simple yet effective project built using the ESP8266 microcontroller. It creates a Wi-Fi Access Point and captures HTTP traffic and real-time DNS logs from connected client devices. The intercepted logs are displayed on a live web dashboard hosted directly on the ESP8266's built-in web server.

✨ New Feature
📤 Logs can now be pushed directly to a local FTP server for easy storage and retrieval, in addition to being displayed on the web interface.
